## DirNotes
A sticky notes widget for the [KDE Plasma desktop](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/).

## TODO (roughly ordered by priority):
- Install dir in cmake file?
- give items in dir tree context menu
	- replacing the "new note" and "open in file manager" buttons
- file watcher for open note: notify user when file changed on disk
- fix ordering in dir tree (make case insensitive)
- Markdown Highlighting
- vim-style navigation (using Alt+hjklweb)
- i18n
